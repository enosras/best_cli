CREATING THE CLI

As an old school programmer (and also an art writer in an alternate universe), most of the funamental concepts that usshered my generation to computing are now deprecated. 

Visual Basics was my introduction to computing, and when the language died, I was grief stricken, but because of my old school training, modern languages, most of whom were designed and tested after I left engineering school, almost sound straightforward. I have taken a cli (list file and directory) app, with supercharged features.

I believe a combination of this app within the ratatui framework can be more effective, especially in tooling, as we race on better ways for prompting, editing code, debugging, and using the AI to our advantage. We still have the advantage of using such powerful features such as fzf.
